## Code Faster Jekyll Theme

**Code Faster** is a very minimal and light weight Jekyll theme with a built-in dark mode made to be easy on eyes.

The theme comes with pre-installed analytics, disqus and html compressor.
To enable them make sure you edit the `_config.yml` first


## Installation
### 1. Fork this repository

(Assuming you are on this page and logged into GitHub) Fork this repository by clicking the `Fork` button on the top right corner. 

#### What is "forking"?

A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking means copying this whole repository and all the files into your github.


### 2. Rename the repository to `<yourusername>.github.io`

This will create a GitHub User page ready with the `Code Faster Jekyll` template that will be available at `https://<yourusername>.github.io` within a couple minutes.  To do this, click on `Settings` at the top (the cog icon) and there you'll have an option to rename.

### 3. Customize your website settings

Edit the `_config.yml` file to change all the settings to reflect your site.
